   - Track MTD Total Funded Amount and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.

3. **Total Amount Received**  
   - Track the total repayments received from borrowers to assess cash flow.  
   - Analyze MTD Total Amount Received and observe MoM variations.

4. **Average Interest Rate**  
   - Calculate the average interest rate across all loans and MTD.
